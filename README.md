We’ll go step by step:
✅ Creating a custom intents.json for natural conversation
✅ Training a Machine Learning model using TensorFlow
✅ Implementing Speech Recognition for listening
✅ Adding Text-to-Speech for natural voice output
✅ Executing real tasks: opening apps, searching Google, playing music, giving time/date, weather reports, notes, Wikipedia summaries & more
✅ Adding smart conversational responses and personality

This is a complete End-to-End AI Assistant Project in Python — perfect for beginners, students, and anyone wanting to build a JARVIS-like AI for their portfolio.

✨ By the end, you’ll learn how to:

✅Understand NLP + Intent Classification
✅Train an AI model to detect user commands
✅Build a fully functional voice assistant
✅Connect AI with real system actions
✅Create a natural, human-like conversational flow

📌 Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow, NLP, SpeechRecognition, Pyttsx3, JSON, Machine Learning

💬 Whether you're new to AI or building your next project, this tutorial will show you how to turn a simple idea into your own personal JARVIS.
